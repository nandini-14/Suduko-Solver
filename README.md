Suduko-Solver
SUDOKU SOLVER

•	Sudoku is the Japanese abbreviation of a phrase meaning the digits must remain single, also known as Number Place, where Su means number, doku which translates as single or bachelor.

•	It is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

•	Proper Sudoku have one solution. Players and investigators may use a wide range of computer algorithms to solve Sudoku, study their properties, and make new puzzles, including Sudoku with interesting symmetries and other properties.

 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

•	There are several computer algorithms that will solve most 9×9 puzzles (n=9) in fractions of a second, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudoku that can be constructed, analyze, and solved as n increases. Therefore, our aim is to use the best technique possible.

•	To successfully implement a novel approach to solve computationally intensive problems like Sudoku.

•	To solve the classical Sudoku puzzle using Brute Force and Backtracking approach.

•	To make sure a solution is guaranteed in all test cases.

•	To take input into the puzzle both by entering the values manually or reading a file with values in it.

ADVANTAGES OF OUR APPROACH

•	The algorithm (and therefore the program code) is simpler than other algorithms, especially compared to strong algorithms that ensure a solution to the most difficult puzzles.            
•	A solution is guaranteed (as long as the puzzle is valid).
•	Solving time is mostly unrelated to degree of difficulty.
DISADVANTAGES
•	The solving time may be slow compared to algorithms modeled after deductive methods.
